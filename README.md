## Objectives

Develop a predictive model to forecast future drug overdose death rates for each demographic group.

Build a machine learning model to identify individuals or demographics at the highest risk of drug overdose deaths. Use features like drug type, age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin.
## Motivation
As students that live in the Seattle area, drugs are a common topic in our everyday conversations due to the large number of the homeless population that resides in our city. Visually, drug addiction within our neighborhoods is apparent. Needles can be seen on our sidewalks with people idly standing with muscle-rigidity. As members of the community, we are encouraged to carry naloxone, a medicine that reverses the effects of various drug overdoses. Through this project, we hope to go beyond aesthetics and dive deeper into various indicators of drug overdoses, which will ultimately expand our understanding about which factors and traits seem to be the most susceptible to overdoses.
## Data Setting and Context

This data was provided by the National Center for Health Statistics, and accessed from the Center for Disease Control's website, which supports the validity of the data. The years from dataset span from 1999 to 2018, which results in approximately 18 years of data to analyze. The NCHS pulls their data from death and medcal records, meaning that the population that is encapsulated by this dataset would be those whose death and medical situations have been institutionally filed by within the United States. Possible biases may against populations that live in homelessness, poverty, or exclusion, as death records require either a form of identification or an identifier, and if a body is neglected long enough, the body be visually unidentifiable.

## Conclusion

**OBJECTIVES FROM SPEC:**


Develop a predictive model to forecast future drug overdose death rates for each demographic group.

- Build a machine learning model to identify individuals or demographics at the highest risk of drug overdose deaths. Use features like drug type, age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin.

Our model was able to predict with a 97% accuracy the death rates of drug overdoses in the United States from our given dataset. From our bar plot of the feature selections, we can see that the demographic with the most importance is MALE with a 216 F score. The "White" and "American Indian or Alaska Native" features come in second and third importance.
